* My literate =zsh= configuration.

This is my zsh configuration as [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] document, based off of my
previous [[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh]] setup. So the setup presented here is at the moment
almost completly owed to the crazy and wonderful croud assambled
there. And to Sven Guckes and Julius Plenz -- their book "zsh - Die
magische Shell" is a helpful resource in setting up zsh.

Not everything is explained in prose yet, but I'll get there, for my
own good.

This is, and will be, a work in progress. And somtime I hope a work of
beauty.

The whole configuration setup is in =zshrc.org=, the file is split
during tangling.

** Prerequisites
- emacs 24
- org-mode >= 7.8.03 (exported after 23d january 2012)
- make

** Installation
- Clone the github repository
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd $HOME
    git clone git://github.com/tomterl/zshorg.git .zshorg
  #+END_SRC

- Read the file =zshrc.org= and tinker with the settings.
   
- Backup your existing config
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    mkdir -p ~/Backups
    tar cfvz ~/Backups/zsh-config-$(date +"%F-%T") ~/.zshrc ~/.zsh.d
  #+END_SRC
- Generate the new config
  Either =C-c C-v C-t= while visiting the file =zshrc.org= in emacs, or
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd ~/.zshorg
    make tangle
  #+END_SRC
  this will overwrite =~/.zshrc= and a couple of files in =~/.zsh.d=;
  make sure you have backups. If you use the makefile, you have to
  tweak the =ORGINSTALL= variable or provide it at the commandline
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd ~/.zshorg
    make tangle ORGINSTALL=your/actual/path/to/the/org/elc/files
  #+END_SRC
- Install external addons
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    make externals
  #+END_SRC
** External addons
Addons resp. plugins are managed using ~antibody~.  To update them issue ~make update-externals~.
